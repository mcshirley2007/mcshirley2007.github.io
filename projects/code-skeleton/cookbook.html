        <h2>
                I have a well-established love of ice cream, with over 150 
                ice cream recipes here on the website, and yet I still make 
                this simple ice cream recipe at least once a month. There’s a 
                reason why we call this the easiest (and best!) ice cream you 
                will ever make or taste.

            <li>Pour 1 cup of the cream into a saucepan and add the sugar 
                and salt. If using a vanilla bean, scrape the seeds of the bean
                 into the mixture and then add the vanilla pod to the
